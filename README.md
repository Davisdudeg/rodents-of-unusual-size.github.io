### Additions and Changes

Make additions and changes to the site by submitting a Pull Request. You can do this directly from
GitHub by following these steps:

2. Add or edit files:

3. Commit your changes:

4. If you need to add an image, upload it and again commit changes:

5. Go back to the main site and make a Pull Request:

6. Name your Pull Request and submit it:

7. Ask another collaborator to review and approve your changes:

8. Once your Pull Request is approved, merge it into the master branch:

Once merged, your branch will be automatically deleted.

9. Within a short time your changes should be available on the site. Verify things look how you expected. If anything
doesn't look right, repeat the above steps and fix it.
